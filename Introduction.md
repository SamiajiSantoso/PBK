# Introduction

I have always had a burning desire to understand how the universe
works, what life is all about, and the meaning and purpose for
which I am here. In retrospect, I can see that my entire life has been
devoted to my search for truth and understanding.

I was brought up in a very intellectual, well-educated, non-
religious family. My parents were essentially atheists, and very early
on, I remember having the attitude that a belief in God was a
human fabrication, a fantasy, a superstition created to help people
feel better about the totally unexplained, and unexplainable,
predicament we seem to find ourselves in. Human existence, or any
other kind of existence, was simply an accident of nature and had
no particularly fathomable meaning. I preferred to admit that I
didn’t know how we got here or why, rather than to adopt a simplistic 
explanation merely to gain a sense of security. I believed that
truth was rational and anything that couldn’t be proved scientifically didn’t exist. 
I also felt somewhat condescending toward people who were weak enough to have to make up a god to believe in.

The positive side of this upbringing was that I didn’t get a lot
of the rigid dogma and deeply negative messages about right and
wrong, heaven and hell, and sin that so many people receive in their
early religious training. On the other hand, I had no conscious con-
cept or experience of the spiritual dimension of life, and no answers
for the questions I had about the meaning and purpose of my life.
